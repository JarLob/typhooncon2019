# TyphoonCon Challenge 2019

During TyphoonCon 2019 we held an open contest which involved a specially crafted program we
provided. The goal of the contest was to code a program which, when launched, interacts with the
challenge program via network traffic and obtained the hidden message: "TyphoonCon 2019 Get this
string first!".

The winners:
* First Place: Niklas Breitfeld @brymko
* Second Place: Tom Dohrmann @13Erbse
* Third Place: Peace-Maker @jhartung10
