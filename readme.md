## TyphoonCon

We believe that researchers want to share their research, discovery and experience with all security enthusiasts, so we created an all offensive security conference just for that!
TyphoonCon (previously beVX) is organized by SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure, and was held in Seoul, South Korea on June 2019.
TyphoonCon focuses on highly technical offensive security issues such as vulnerability discovery, advanced exploitation techniques and reverse engineering.
